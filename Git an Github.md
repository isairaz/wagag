# What is Github ?

* Github is a space where you can share you " developing works " :)
  you can share in public or private you're works.
  
* People can be also proposing some modification of the code of developers works .
  People who want to propose some modification download the work of the develeloper and do modification on their side and after publies the " modificate work " .
  
* For me, it can be also utile, if you're a web developer junior, to share what you can do and share you're works.
  Personnaly, i did that and in my repository you can see all my works that i've already do and my portfolio.
  It's more simple because you have only to share you're " Github link " and people can see 
  for example, you're portfolio ( if you want that when we click on you're " Github link " there is you're portfolio the file where the portfolio it is have to be 
  index.html, or index.md ) and of course you can also share you're repository link to people see all you're works and not only you're portfolio.
  
 # What is Git ?
 
 * Git is a tool that utile for track all you're files projects. So all modifications of you're file is view per Git and you have same a history of
   all you're modifications. Git is not telepath x) so if you do modication you have to speficy to Git and for that ther is a simple way to do that in you're terminal
   is " Git commit - m < title ( the best is specify in this title what modifications you have do ) > " and then " Git push origin master ".
   
 * Git is also very helpful if for example you work in a society with a lot of co-workers and you work on the same project, you know what, who and when you're coworkers
   have do modification on you're work.
   
 * Another avantage on Git it is, in the same situation above, all you're co-workers can work on you're project of their side with their personally " branch " and then
   everybody can merge all the branch on one and unique file .
